- 👋 Hi, I’m @CruZer87659
- 👀 I’m a versatile illustrator, easily adapting to various artistic styles. Additionally, I'm skilled at proposing creative and original alternatives that effectively convey your needs. My personal style involves engaging in projects that demand conceptualization, as I believe aesthetics are intertwined with the audience and the intended message. Therefore, I don't adhere strictly to a particular aesthetic. However, I'm passionate about delivering results with painterly, contrasting, and colorful finishes. It's worth noting that I work with sketches and storyboards as part of my process.

- 🌱 Since 2019, I have been working remotely with creative teams at Bilibob, Go Team, Calliope, among various independent entities; some based in Spain, Colombia, Panama; USA, and others. We develop animated stories for audiovisual media. I've been involved in visual proposals, sketching, storyboarding, character design, landscape design, illustrations, storytelling, and creating unique and beautiful pieces that have garnered positive feedback and reception from clients.

- 💞️ I work to empower projects. I contribute to the visual creation of audiovisual compositions, the crafting of characters, and illustrations for digital media, corporate videos, infographics, and animated elements destined for educational institutions, environmental care, and nature conservation, among many others. Art guides my spirit. I strive to contribute a valuable grain of sand in every creative process. Through constant exploration and adaptation to new trends, I aspire to leave my modest yet significant mark in the creative world that surrounds me.
